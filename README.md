# SketchMotion 🎨✨

**Welcome to the era of Gemini 3.**

SketchMotion is an **iterative human-in-the-loop context building sketch suggestions tool** built for the **Gemini 3 Global Hackathon**. It transforms the solitary act of sketching into a collaborative dialogue with AI, where your rough ideas are understood, refined, and brought to life in real-time.

## 🚀 About the Project

Traditional AI tools often feel like black boxes: you give an input, you get an output. SketchMotion changes this paradigm by introducing an **interactive feedback loop**.

Instead of guessing what you want from a single prompt, SketchMotion **watches you draw**, predicts your intent in real-time, and asks for verification. This "context building" approach ensures that the AI understands the _nuance_ of your specific creation, leading to far more accurate and relevant results than simple one-shot generation.

## 💎 Gemini 3 Integration

SketchMotion is powered by the **Gemini 3 Model Family**, leveraging specific models for different stages of the user experience to optimize for both speed and intelligence.

| Feature | Model | Why? |
|Feature|Model|Why?|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Real-time Visual Reasoning**|**Gemini 3 Flash** ⚡|We utilize Flash's multimodal capabilities to not just "see" pixels, but to _reason_ about spatial relationships. It differentiates between a "circle" that is a wheel vs. a "circle" that is a sun based on the surrounding context.|
|**Deep Contextual Analysis**|**Gemini 3 Pro** 🧠|When ambiguity is high, Pro steps in. It handles the "Reasoning" phase of our pipeline, synthesizing user feedback history with visual data to construct a coherent scene graph.|
|**Hi-Fi Generation**|**Gemini Image Generation** 🎨|A specialized pipeline that transforms the crude sketch into professional assets. It uses the _verified context_ to build a highly specific prompt, ensuring the output matches the user's intent perfectly.|

### The Gemini Pipeline

We treat the Gemini 3 API not just as a classifier, but as a **Collaborative Reasoning Engine**.

```mermaid

    DualView[👁️ Dual-View Input] -->|Intent + Context| Reasoning[🧠 Reasoning Engine]
    Reasoning -.->|Gemini 3 Pro| PromptEng[🔄 Prompt Engineering]
    PromptEng -->|Dynamic Constraints| Suggestion[�️ Suggestion]

    UserParams -- Yes --> Lock[✅ verified: Lock to Graph]
    UserParams -- No --> SelfCorrect[📝 Self-Correction]

    SelfCorrect -->|Inject 'NOT X'| PromptEng
```

**Contextual Prompt Construction**:
Every time Gemini analyzes a stroke, it doesn't just look at the image. It reads the **Session Context Graph**.

1.  **Ingest**: Gemini receives the _intent image_ (bright strokes) vs _context image_ (dim strokes).
2.  **Recall**: It pulls previous affirmations. _Example: "User already confirmed the 'green circle' is a 'tree'."_
3.  **Synthesize**: It constructs a dynamic prompt:
    > "Analyze the bright strokes. CONTEXT: The green circle nearby is a TREE. Therefore, is this bright stroke likely a falling apple or a bird? NOTE: User previously rejected 'cloud'."
4.  **Predict**: It returns a result that is logically consistent with the established scene.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is built on a **Serverless/Edge Architecture** to ensure low latency for global users. The frontend handles real-time interactions and heuristic processing, while the edge backend manages AI orchestration and session state.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client[🎨 Client UI]
    Edge[⚡ Edge API]
    Gemini[🧠 Gemini 3 API]
    KV[(🗄️ Session KV)]

    Client -->|1. Stroke Data| Edge

    Gemini -->|3. Result| Edge
    Edge -->|4. Suggestion| Client
    Edge -->|Context Memory| KV
    Client -->|5. Feedback| Edge
```

### Component Breakdown

1.  **Client (Svelte 5 & Canvas)**:
    - Handles high-frequency input (60fps drawing).
    - Runs the **Heuristic Grouping Engine** locally to minimize API calls.
    - Manages the "Optimistic UI" for instant feedback.

2.  **Edge API (Cloudflare Workers)**:
    - Acts as the orchestration layer.
    - Implements **Rate Limiting** and **Session Management**.
    - Constructs complex, multi-modal prompts for Gemini.

3.  **Session Memory (Cloudflare KV)**:
    - Stores the "Mind Map" of the current drawing session.
    - Persists user confirmations ("This is a cat", "This is NOT a dog") to guide future AI predictions.

## 🔄 Data Flow & Logic

### 1. The Stroke Lifecycle

Every line you draw goes through a rigorous normalization process before it ever sees an AI.

1.  **Raw Input**: Pointer events are captured.
2.  **Smoothing**: Catmull-Rom splines are applied to smooth wobbly lines.
3.  **Feature Extraction**: We calculate geometric properties for every stroke:
    - _Temporal_: When was it drawn?
    - _Spatial_: Center of mass, bounding box.
    - _Kinematic_: Speed and acceleration.

### 2. Smart Grouping Engine

To prevent sending random noise to the AI, we implemented a custom **Heuristic Clustering Algorithm** that runs entirely in the browser. It groups strokes into "Candidates" based on likelihood of belonging to the same object.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Raw[Raw Strokes] --> Temporal{Wait < 1s?}
    Temporal -- Yes --> Spatial{Distance > Threshold?}
    Temporal -- No --> NewGroup1[New Group]

    Spatial -- Yes --> NewGroup2[New Group]
    Spatial -- No --> Geometry{Enclosed or Connected?}

    Geometry -- Yes --> Merge[MERGE Group]
    Geometry -- No --> NewGroup3[New Group]

    NewGroup3 -.->|Missed something?| AI[Gemini Semantic Check]
    AI -- "Merge Suggestion" --> Merge
```

- **Temporal Coherence**: Strokes drawn in quick succession are likely related.
- **Spatial Containment**: A small stroke inside a larger one (like an eye in a face) is automatically grouped.
- **Kinematic Similarity**: Strokes drawn with similar speed and pressure are grouped.

#### 🤖 AI Semantic Correction (The Safety Net)

Heuristics aren't perfect. Sometimes, you draw a flock of birds, and the algorithm misses one. Or you draw a Giraffe, and the spots aren't grouped with the body.

When Gemini analyzes the scene, it performs a **Semantic Integrity Check**:

1.  **Color-Coded Context**: We pass the full scene to Gemini where every existing group has a unique color outline ID.
2.  **Visual Reasoning**: Gemini looks at the image and reasons: _"Hey, these 3 separate groups (circles) are actually spots inside this larger group (Giraffe body)."_
3.  **Merge/Split Suggestions**: The API returns explicit instructions to **MERGE** Group A, B, and C, or **SPLIT** Group D.
    - _Example 1_: Merging a stray "bird" stroke back into the "Flock" group.
    - _Example 2_: Merging "spots" + "body" + "neck" into a single "Giraffe" entity.

### 3. AI Analysis Loop

Once the grouping engine identifies a stable Candidate, the **AI Analysis Loop** begins. This is a two-pass visual analysis system.

1.  **Intent Image Generation**: The client generates a specific image containing _only_ the candidate strokes (bright white on black).
2.  **Context Image Generation**: A second image is generated showing the _rest_ of the sketch (dimmed gray), providing spatial context.
3.  **Prompt Construction**: The Edge API combines these images with the Session History.

```mermaid

    participant System
    participant Gemini

    User->>System: Draws Strokes
    System->>System: Groups Strokes
    System->>Gemini: Analyze (Intent + Context)
    Gemini-->>System: Suggestion: "Wheel"
    System-->>User: "Is this a Wheel?"

    User->>System: "YES"
    System->>System: Lock Context ("Wheel")
```

### 4. Context & Memory

The "Secret Sauce" of SketchMotion is its memory. The system builds a graph of known truths about the sketch.

- **Positive Reinforcement**: When you verify a prediction ("Yes, it's a tree"), that information is **locked**. The AI will assume that object is a tree in all future requests, helping it understand scale and perspective.
- **Negative Constraints**: When you reject a prediction ("No, it's not a car"), that label is added to a **Negative Constraint List** for that specific group. Future prompts effectively say: _"Analyze this. We know for a fact it is NOT a car."_

### 🔮 Future Roadmap: Multimodal Video Analysis

We are currently exploring **Gemini 3's Video Input capabilities** to take this to the next level. Static images lose the _temporal_ information of a sketch.

- **Video as Context**: Instead of sending a static PNG, we plan to stream the **drawing process as a video** to Gemini.
- **Dynamic Intent Recognition**: By analyzing the _speed_ and _hesitation_ of strokes, Gemini can infer intent.
  - _Fast, jagged lines_ → "Grass" or "Rough Texture"
  - _Slow, careful curves_ → "Cloud" or "Smooth Surface"
- **Motion cues for Animation**: Understanding _how_ a user draws a line (e.g., the direction of a wave) can automatically dictate how that object should be animated in the final output.

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### The Workflow

1.  **Draw**: Sketch naturally. The **Smart Grouping** will automatically collect your strokes.
2.  **Verify**: Look for the floating label. Click **Check** (✓) to confirm the AI's guess.
3.  **Correct**: Click **Cross** (✗) if it's wrong. The AI will immediately re-analyze with your feedback in mind.
4.  **Iterate**: As you confirm more objects, the AI's understanding of the scene improves ("Oh, that's a tree next to the house I already know about").
5.  **Finalize**: Use the **Generate** tool to turn your verified sketch into a polished asset.
